# Requirements
You will need [python 3.10.12](https://www.python.org/) and the following dependencies:
- [OpenCV 4.8.1](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
- [MediaPipe 0.10.8](https://pypi.org/project/mediapipe/)
- [pyvirtualcam 0.10.2](https://pypi.org/project/pyvirtualcam/)

I recommend using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/) to isolate the environment.

You will also need to install a virtual camera for [pyvirtualcam](https://pypi.org/project/pyvirtualcam/) to output to.
